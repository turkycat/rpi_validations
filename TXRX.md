# Communicating through TX/RX pins
Learn how to use HardwareSerial to communicate across TX/RX pins and view it on the computer using a USB TTL Serial Cable

# Info on using HardwareSerial
* Serial = COM1 = TX/RX pins<br/>
* While this sample doesn't use a serial event, if you want to use serialEvent, you will need to:
    * Create a method for <code>serialEvent()</code> that returns void and has no parameters in your main.cpp. This method will be called when data is available on the serial1 port at the end of the loop.
    * Right click on the Project in the Solution Explorer, then select <kbd>Properties</kbd>.
    * Under Configuration Properties -> C/C++ -> Preprocessor, add <kbd>SERIAL_EVENT;</kbd> to Preprocessor Definitions.

# Required Components
* [FTDI Cable](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9717){:target="_blank"}
* 2 wires to connect the TX and RX pins to the FTDI Cable

# Create the project

1. Create a new project from the template.
1. Plug the USB end of the cable into your computer's USB port.
1. Open up Device Manager on your development machine and find out which COM port is being used by the adapter.
1. Open a terminal program like [Tera Term](http://download.cnet.com/Tera-Term/3000-20432_4-75766675.html){:target="_blank"}
1. Set the program to monitor the serial connection from the COM port you found in Step 5.
1. Make sure your options are as shown below (with the Port set to the COM port you found in Step 5):<br/>

    * If you are using Tera Term, you can get to the menu shown above by clicking on Setup -> Serial port..
1. Hook up the Orange pin from the cable to RX (pin 0)on your Galileo
1. Hook up the Yellow pin from the cable to TX (pin 1) on your Galileo
1. Replace the existing code in main.cpp of the project with the code below:

# Code

### Main.cpp of the Write Project
{% highlight C++ %}

int count = 0;

void setup()
{
    Serial.begin(CBR_300, Serial.SERIAL_7O2);
}

void loop()
{
    if( Serial.write('a' + count) != 1 )
    {
        //write failed
    }
	else
	{
        //write was successfulcount
		count++;
    }
	
	//reset the count when it passes Z
    if( count == 26 )
	{
	  count = 0;
	}
	
    delay(1000);
}
{% endhighlight %}

##Result

Each character from a - z will be written via the serial pins with a 1 second delay between each character. This will be repeated until the program stops.
